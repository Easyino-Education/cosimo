# Easyino Cosimo
 Who's Cosimo?
 Well, Cosimo is one special element of the **Easyino Family**.
We started thinking about him at the end of 2020, and we are still designing it now. 

## What does cosimo look like?
Well, if you meet Cosimo on the street he'll appear to you as a simple **USB device**, with an **Oled display** and some **buttons**. As you can see, we used an **ESP8266** for building his head, that allow him to chat wireless with his friends! 

If you start chatting with Cosimo, you'll discover how many things
 he can do, and how versatile he is. For example he can **store your password** for having an secure and fast login. He can also **execute command**, **write string of text**, and **automate all routine** you want!
